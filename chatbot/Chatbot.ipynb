              " {'answer': 'hello and welcome to ehealth forum! this is a personal and religious decision but considering the circumstances it is best to opt for abortion. otherwise you need to inform your parents about it. the best way to do is go for a dilatation and curettage. vacuum evacuation can be tried before 7 weeks of pregnancy. if you do not want that then you can try a drug which contains a chemical called mifepristone. the best method through pills is a combination of mifepristone plus prostaglandin. discuss this with the gynecologist. i would suggest you consult a gynecologist if your pregnancy test is positive and not go for any pills on your own as they carry the danger of incomplete abortion and very heavy bleeding. a dose higher than the required dose can cause damage to the uterus too. so please do not self medicate. after the termination think in terms of inserting iud or other such devices like implanon or go for pills. please consult your gynecologist. hope this helps. take care!',\n",

              " {'answer': \"you seem concerned about the stiffness in your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child's movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child's ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: â\\x80¢ the patterns of movement the child presents with; â\\x80¢ age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; â\\x80¢ the child's present capabilities; â\\x80¢ examination of the child's posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized 'problem-solving' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of 'key points' on the child's body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this helps. take care. note: this post is not to emphasise final diagnosis as the same cannot be made online and is aimed just to provide medical information and no treatment suggested above be taken without face to face consultation with health care professional.\",\n",

              " {'answer': \"it seems that you brother is experiencing gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd). stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers. traditionally anti-acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms. although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long-term cure. if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time. because medication has not proven successful in the long-term the next option is a surgical procedure called 'nissen fundoplication'. this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision (unless performed via keyhole surgery 'laparoscopy). the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to 'burp' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called 'endoscopic fundoplication'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.\",\n",

              " {'answer': \"hello. from your description here it seems you are troubled with the anger issues more than anything else. and the recurrence of the anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking 'during' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md (this post is for the purpose of providing medical information and is not a substitute for a face-to-face consultation with a doctor. this post is not intended to give or rule out a diagnosis create a doctor-patient relationship or replace an existing one. i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online. please consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment options)\",\n",
